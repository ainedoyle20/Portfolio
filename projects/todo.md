# Productivity Tracker

![Productivity Tracker Cover!](/images/projects/todo.png)

## Using Productivity-Tracker

In order to access your data you must first create an account and log in. You can do this with your email or with your Google account.          

Once logged in you will be directed to the Home Page. Here you can create, edit, complete or delete tasks for that day.

If you wish to schedule future taks, or view past ones, navigate to the Schedule Page. You can navigate between all pages using the Side Navigation bar. On the Schedule Page you will be shown a calendar and you can choose any future day to add tasks to. Note however that if you choose a past date, you may only view the tasks, if any, for that date. You will not be able to alter them.

To view your productivity improvment / deterioration navigate to the Progress Page. Here a line chart with your data for the current month will be displayed. To view your data for past months simply toggle the Back button.

There is a logout option on the Side Navigation bar when you wish to sign out.
