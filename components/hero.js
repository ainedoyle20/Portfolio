                My name is Aine Doyle. I'm a self taught web developer living in Ireland and currently building web applications using React and Next js. <br/> <br/>
                I am disciplined, hard working and eager to work in an environment where I can learn from experienced developers.<br/> <br/>
                I enjoy studying new libraries and implementing them into my projects. For example, I built this website using Nextjs and Tailwind CSS. <br/> <br/>
                I've included four of my favourite projects along with my CV, Contact Information and links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts. <br /> <br/>
                Have a look around and feel free to send me an email or contact me through LinkedIn if you want me on your team!
